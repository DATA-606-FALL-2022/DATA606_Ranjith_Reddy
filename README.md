## Description

Whether you shop from meticulously planned grocery lists or let whimsy guide your grazing, our distinct food rituals define who we are. Instacart, a grocery ordering and delivery app, aims to make it simple to stock your refrigerator and pantry with your personal favorites and staples when you need them. Personal shoppers review your order and do the in-store shopping and delivery for you after you select products via the Instacart application.


## Idea

- Huge demand and potential for online e-commerce. Companies have been leveraging data analysis to understand customer behavior, market trends, and machine learning for product recommendations. 
- In this project, I would like to analyze online grocery shopping data to gain insights about customer purchase and market trends. 
- I would like to use this anonymized data on customer orders over time to predict which previously purchased products will be in a user’s next order using classification techniques. 
- Further I would like to build a product recommender system that recommends products for a given user based on the available order history and similar user ratings using association rule mining. 


## About Data

Source: An online grocery shopping dataset is taken from Kaggle for the project.  This can be found at: 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/instacart-online-grocery-basket-analysis-dataset
Size of the dataset is 1.28 GB with around 3.4 Million user transactions recorded.
The dataset consists of 5 CSV files, each file describing a different aspect of the data including aisles, departments, orders, products and order behavior. Each entity (customer, product, order, aisle, etc.) has an associated unique id. Most of the files and variable names should be self-explanatory.
  1. aisles.csv(aisle id, aisle description)
  2. departments.csv(dept id, dept name)
  3. order_products.csv(order_id, product_id, add_to_cart_order, reordered)
  4. orders.csv(order_id, user_id, eval_set, order_number, order_dow, order_hour_of_delay, days_since_prior)
  5. products.csv(product_id, product_name, aisle_id, dept_id)
