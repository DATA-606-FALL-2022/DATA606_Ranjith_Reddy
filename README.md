## Description

Whether you shop from meticulously planned grocery lists or let whimsy guide your grazing, our distinct food rituals define who we are. Instacart, a grocery ordering and delivery app, aims to make it simple to stock your refrigerator and pantry with your personal favorites and staples when you need them. Personal shoppers review your order and do the in-store shopping and delivery for you after you select products via the Instacart application.


## Idea

- Huge demand and potential for online e-commerce. Companies have been leveraging data analysis to understand customer behavior, market trends, and machine learning for product recommendations. 
- In this project, I would like to analyze online grocery shopping data to gain insights about customer purchase and market trends. 
- I would like to use this anonymized data on customer orders over time to predict which previously purchased products will be in a userâ€™s next order using classification techniques. 
- Further I would like to build a product recommender system that recommends products for a given user based on the available order history and similar user ratings using association rule mining. 


## About Data

Source: An online grocery shopping dataset is taken from Kaggle for the project.  This can be found at: 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/instacart-online-grocery-basket-analysis-dataset
Size of the dataset is 1.28 GB with around 3.4 Million user transactions recorded.
The dataset consists of 5 CSV files, each file describing a different aspect of the data including aisles, departments, orders, products and order behavior. Each entity (customer, product, order, aisle, etc.) has an associated unique id. Most of the files and variable names should be self-explanatory.
  1. aisles.csv(aisle id, aisle description)
  2. departments.csv(dept id, dept name)
  3. order_products.csv(order_id, product_id, add_to_cart_order, reordered)
  4. orders.csv(order_id, user_id, eval_set, order_number, order_dow, order_hour_of_delay, days_since_prior)
  5. products.csv(product_id, product_name, aisle_id, dept_id)

  2. Probability of a basket having 0 reordered products: 11.868056
  3. Probability of a basket having 1 reordered products: 10.262626
  4. Probability of a basket having 2 reordered products: 10.326791
  5. Probability of a basket having 3 reordered products: 9.735981

### Time effects on purchasing behaviours
  - How Time affects the purchasing behaviour of customers?
  - Most orders are ordered on Day 0 and Day 1.
  - Orders are mostly ordered during day, from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM.
  - Peak orders happens at Saturday afternoon (1:00PM), and Sunday morning (10:00AM)
  - By more than 65%, People usually buy previously ordered products from 6:00AM to 8:00AM
  - Most users make orders after a week from their last order. or from a month of their last order.
  - After a week from the last order, the probability of reordering within the same month is small. 
      - Send reminders of the most likely ordered products within a week, to catch the high prob of a customer to make their next order.
  - The Next order has higher probability to be during 10 days from the current order.

### Association between days since last order and the ratio of reorders
  - 74 % of products bought at the same day of prev order, are reorders.
  - 69% of products bought after 1 week of prev order, are reorders
    #### Conculsion:
      - If future order will be at the same day of prev order, percentage of reorders in the future product is high.
      - If future order will be after a week from the prev order, percentage of reorders in the future product is high.
